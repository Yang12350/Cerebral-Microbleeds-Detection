This dataset has been collected with a collaboration between Medical Imaging LABoratory (MILAB) at Yonsei University and Gachon University Gil Medical Center.

Our dataset contains two in-plane resolutions as follows:
1. High in-plane resolution (HR): 0.50x0.50 mm^2, and
2. Low in-plane resolution (LR): 0.80x0.80 mm^2.

HR data composites of 72 subjects, while LR data contains 107 subjects.

The Label folder involves excel files, where each excel file is with the same name as data in the Data folder.
The information of location of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) in brain images are existed in those excel files as follow:
- 1st column represents the slice number of subject,
- 2nd and 3rd columns indicate the x(column-wise) and y(row-wise) pixel location of CMB in that slice, respectively.

When using this dataset for research publications, please cite our paper.
